Comments
====================

In the rest of this module we will use comments to help explain the code so let's look at how they work.

JavaScript supports two types of comments: single-line comments and multi-line comments. Comments allow you to add
notes or explanations to your code that are ignored when the program runs.

**Single-Line Comments**

These comments start with ``//`` and anything after that point is treated as a comment.

.. code-block:: javascript

    // This is a single-line comment
    let age = 16; // This comment explains the variable

**Multi-Line Comments**

These comments start with ``/*`` and end with ``*/``. They can span as many lines as you like.

.. code-block:: javascript

    /*
    This is a multi-line comment.
    It can explain a more complex piece of code.
    */

    let person = "Alice";
