Representing and Storing Data: 8 Queens
=======================================

When taking an algorithm and implementing it in code, it's important to think about **what** data the program will need to store and **how** it will store it.

    To solve the 8 queens problem, we'll need a way to store the chessboard configurations. Describe how you might do this. You should also provide a concrete example for how

    **Board A**

    .. image:: img/5_queens1.png
        :width: 200
        :align: center

    and **Board B**

    .. image:: img/5_queens2.png
        :width: 200
        :align: center

    would be represented in your system.

    Consider a program that implements backtracking to solve the 8 queens problem. Can you come up with a list of all the data you would need to store in your program?

    Create a data dictionary for all of the variables you would need to create when implementing backtracking to solve the 8 queens problem.

    .. list-table:: 
        :header-rows: 0

        * - Variable Name
          - Data Type
          - Size in Bytes
          - Description
          - Example
