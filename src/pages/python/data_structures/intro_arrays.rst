Introduction to Arrays
======================

An **array** is a fundamental data structure found in most programming
languages. Arrays allow you to store a preset number of values (elements)
together in one block of memory. This allows for quick access for values in the
array, if you know you want the third value, you can go directly to it. This is
in contrast to lists, which can have their elements spread out in the
computer's memory, making accessing elements slower.

An array is a little like a chest of drawers. Each drawer (or element) can hold
some stuff (a value), and all the drawers are stacked in a sequence. If we want
the contents of the third drawer, we can simply open the third drawer without
checking the first and second drawers. Like drawers that can only store items
of a specific size or type, arrays can only hold values of the same type like
``int`` or ``float``.

In Python, it is common to use lists to represent arrays.

You’ve already encountered lists in Python, but there’s a twist—\ **you can
have lists of lists!** These are similar to multidimensional arrays found in
other programming languages.
