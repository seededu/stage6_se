Records
=======

A **record** is a data structure that allows you to store a fixed number of related pieces of information together as a single entity. Each piece of information in a record is called a **field**, and every field typically represents a specific attribute or property of the entity being described and fields do not have to have the same type (unlike arrays).

Think of a record like a form you might fill out at a doctor's office. The form contains fields such as your name, age, phone number, and address. All these fields together describe one entityâ€”you. Similarly, in programming, a record groups together related data into a structured format, making it easier to organise and work with.

Records in Python
-----------------

In Python, a simple and efficient way to represent records is by using **tuples**. We can create a tuple the same way we create a list but a tuple uses parentheses ``()``. A tuple is an immutable sequence of elements (meaning that once the tuple is created it can't be modified), and its fixed structure makes it a great choice for representing records with a defined set of fields. Each position in the tuple corresponds to a specific field.

For example, suppose you want to represent a student record with their name, age, and the subjects they are taking. You can use a tuple like this:

.. code-block:: python

    student = ('Alex', 17, ['English', 'Maths', 'Software Engineering', 'Drama', 'Textiles'])

Here:

* The first field ``'Alex'`` represents the student's name.

* The second field ``17`` represents their age.

* The third field ``['English', 'Maths', 'Software Engineering', 'Drama', 'Textiles']`` represents the subjects they are taking.

To get values out of a tuple in Python we can index them the same as we do lists:

.. code-block:: python

    student = ('Jordan', 17, ['English', 'Maths', 'Software Engineering', 'Drama', 'Textiles'])

    # Accesses name
    print(student[0])

    # Accesses age
    print(student[1])

    # Accesses subjects
    print(student[2])

    # Accesses first subject
    print(student[2][0])

    How many elements can a record have?

    A. 1

    B. 2-10

        **D.**

        Records can have any number of elements, but all records of the same type must have the same number of elements.

    How do you get the 14 out of this record:

     .. code-block:: python

        record = (13, 14, 15, 16)

    A. ``record[-1]``

    B. ``record[0]``

.. dropdown:: Code challenge: Catalogue A Library
    :color: warning
    :icon: star

    Paige, a librarian, contacts you and asks you to write some code capable of cataloguing every book in their library. Paige asks that you store each book as a record since the details should never change and store the records as a list which may be updated as books are added or removed from the library.

    Here is an example of a book

    .. code-block:: text

        harry_potter = (9780747532699, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", 'Fiction - Children')

    Your task is to write one function which adds a record to the list and another which removes a record from the list, as specified below. These functions should be written in ``library.py``.

    **Add_book specification** (written in ``library.py``)

    * name: ``add_book``

    * parameters: books (``list``), ISBN (``int``), title (``str``), genre (``str``)

    * return: list of records with the new book added (``list``)

    **Remove_book specification** (written in ``library.py``)

    * name: ``remove_book``

    * parameters: books (``list``), ISBN (``int``), title (``str``), genre (``str``)

    * return: list of books with the book matching the provided details removed (``list``)

    **Example** (running from ``main.py``)

    .. code-block:: python

        import library

        books = [(9780007348695, 'The Cat In The Hat', 'Fiction - Children'),
                (9780747532699, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", 'Fiction - Children')]

        books = library.add_book(books, 9780520201798, 'Frankenstein', 'Fiction - Horror')
        books = library.remove_book(books, 9780007348695, 'The Cat In The Hat', 'Fiction - Children')
        print(books)

    .. code-block:: text

        [(9780747532699, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", 'Fiction - Children'), (9780520201798, 'Frankenstein', 'Fiction - Horror')]

    .. hint:: You can delete an element from a list using ``.remove(item).`` Here is an example

        .. exec_code::
            :language: python

            animals = ['lion', 'caterpillar', 'elephant', 'bee']
            animals.remove('elephant') 
            print(animals)
