Modules
=======

The Python Standard Library
---------------------------

Python comes bundled with an extensive library of modules, also known as the `Standard Library <https://docs.python.org/3/library/>`_  Standard Library. This contains a set of modules which give you access to many useful functions you might require for everyday programming. Here are some examples:

* ``print()`` allows us to display information to the screen

* ``int()``, ``float()``, ``str()`` and ``list()`` allow us to convert between variable types

* ``len()``, ``min()``, ``max()``, ``sum()`` allows us to find the length, minimum, maximum and sum of a list

Other modules
-------------
When programming, it is common for a lot of programmers to want to do similar things. To help with this, people write modules. A module contains a collection of functions that are useful for a particular task. For example there is a module that will help you with mathematical calculations, and there is a module that will help you process dates and times.

Installing modules with pip
---------------------------
While you will automatically have access to the Python Standard Library, you will need to install other packages. With pip you can easy install these packages on your machine should you need them. You can look up packages with the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/>`_ .
