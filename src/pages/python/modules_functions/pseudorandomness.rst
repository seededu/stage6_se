Pseudorandomness
================

You will have noticed that every time you generate random numbers, the values
change! However, recreating the same set of random numbers is often important
to ensure your results are reproducible. Lucky for us, the random numbers
generated by the computer aren't *truly* random. They're what we call
**pseudorandom**. If you kept generating random numbers for long enough, the
sequence would repeat!

To force our random numbers to start at the same point in the sequence every
time, we can use a seed. We use

.. code-block:: text

    random.seed(seed)

where seed is an integer. Here's an example. You'll see that the program will
always generate the same results.

.. code-block:: python

    import random

    random.seed(0)
    print(random.random())
    print(random.random())
    print(random.random())

If you don't use a seed you will get different results every time.

You may have seen seeds mentioned in computer games when you want to reproduce
the same conditions e.g. generating the same starting map.

.. dropdown:: Question 1
    :open:
    :color: info
    :icon: question

    You run the following program

    .. code-block:: python

        import random

        random.seed(0)
        print(random.randrange(6))

    The program outputs

    .. code-block:: text

        3

    What happens when you run the program again?

    A. You are guaranteed to get the number 3 again.

    B. It's impossible to say as you'll get either a 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.

        **A.**

        Since a seed is set we will get the same value each time we run this program

        print(random.randrange(6))
        print(random.randrange(6))
