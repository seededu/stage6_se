Cascading Style Sheets
======================

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used to style web pages. While HTML is used
to structure content, CSS is what makes that content look visually appealing by
controlling things like colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing. Without CSS, web pages
would all look the same!

Customisation of a web page's style brings several advantages including:

- pages can be styled to match a desired style e.g. a company's brand
- pages can be designed to be :term:`responsive` to different devices and screen sizes.
- pages can be designed to be :term:`accessible` for people with disabilities

One of the key principles of CSS is the :term:`separation of content and presentation`.
This means that HTML is used to organise the content of the page (like text, images, and
links), while CSS is used to control how that content looks. By keeping the structure
and the style separate, software engineers can easily update the design without changing
the content, and they can apply the same style across multiple pages by reusing CSS
code.

There are three main ways to use CSS in a webpage:

1. inline
2. internal
3. external

We will cover each approach and discuss their use cases.

    Accessible
       Accessible design means creating websites that can be easily used by people with
       disabilities, such as those who use screen readers or have limited mobility.
       This involves ensuring that the layout, text, and navigation are clear and usable
       for everyone.

    Responsive
       esponsive design refers to making a website's layout adapt to different screen
       sizes and devices, like phones, tablets, and desktops. This ensures that the
       website looks good and functions properly no matter what device it's viewed on.

    Separation of content and presentation
       This concept means keeping the structure and meaning of a webpage (the HTML)
       separate from how it looks (the CSS). HTML is used for content, while CSS is
       used to control the style and layout, making it easier to manage and update both
       independently.
