Cascading Style Sheets
======================

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used to style and design web pages. While 
HTML is used to structure content, CSS is what makes that content look visually 
appealing by controlling things like colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing. Without CSS, 
web pages would all look the same!

Customisation of a web page's style brings several advantages including:

* pages can be styled to match a desired style e.g. a company's brand
* pages can be designed to be :term:`responsive` to different devices and screen sizes.
* pages can be designed to be :term:`accessible` for people with visual impairments

One of the key principles of CSS is the :term:`separation of content and presentation`. 
This  means that HTML is used to organise the content of the page (like text, images, 
and links), while CSS is used to control how that content looks. By keeping the 
structure and the style separate, software engineers can easily update the design 
without changing the content, and they can apply the same style across multiple pages 
by reusing CSS code.

There are three main ways to use CSS in a webpage: 

1. inline
2. internal
3. external 

We will cover each approach and discuss their use cases.
