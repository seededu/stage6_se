Tools
========================

In web development, even small mistakes in your code can cause big problems. Validation and testing tools help catch
these issues early, ensuring that every part of your website works correctly across all devices and browsers. Here are
some essential tools and how they can help you build a reliable and high-quality website.

Why Use Validation Tools?

- Saves Time by Identifying Errors Early: Finding and fixing mistakes in your code early prevents them from turning
  into more significant issues later. Validation tools point out errors so you can correct them right away.
- Ensures Compatibility Across Browsers and Devices: A website should look and function the same no matter what browser
  or device itâ€™s viewed on. Validation tools check your code against web standards, which helps maintain consistency
  and compatibility.

HTML and CSS Validators
----------------------------

W3C Markup Validation Service: This service checks your HTML for errors and ensures it follows web standards. It helps
you catch issues like missing tags or improper nesting before they cause problems.

W3C CSS Validator: This tool reviews your CSS code to confirm it meets official specifications. By using the CSS
Validator, you can be confident that your styles will work as expected on different browsers and devices.

JavaScript Linters
----------------------------

Tools like ESLint or JSHint: Linters analyze your JavaScript code for errors and enforce coding style guidelines. They
identify common mistakes and potential bugs, making it easier to maintain clean, readable code.

Accessibility Testing
----------------------------

Tools like Lighthouse, Axe, and WAVE: Accessibility tools evaluate your website to make sure it can be used by people
with disabilities. They check for compliance with accessibility standards, helping you create a more inclusive user
experience.
