Overview
========================

When you visit a website, you probably notice how hard or easy it is to navigate, how quickly it loads, or how well it
works on your phone. These aspects are no accident—they’re the result of careful planning and design focused on UI/UX,
or User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX).

In this module, we’ll explore how to create websites that not only look great but also work seamlessly for users.
You’ll learn how to make your sites adaptable, efficient, and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of the device they’re
using or the speed of their internet connection.

What is UI/UX?
--------------------

- **User Interface (UI)**: The look and feel of a website. It includes things like layout, buttons, colors, and
  typography—everything the user sees and interacts with.
- **User Experience (UX)**: The overall experience of using the website. This covers how intuitive, fast, and satisfying
  the site is to navigate. A great website balances UI and UX to make sure users can easily achieve their goals while
  enjoying the process.

Why is UI/UX Important?
-----------------------------

Website that take forever to load, is hard to use on your phone, or has confusing navigation can drive users away, even
if the website has valuable content.

On the other hand:

- Good UI makes your website attractive and inviting.
- Good UX ensures users can find what they need easily and quickly.
